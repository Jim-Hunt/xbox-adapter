# Xbox Adapter

A sketch for the Arduino Leonardo and USB Host Shield to use a wired Xbox One controller on an original Xbox.

<!--

## Getting started

Install an `Arduino AVR Boards with LUFA` board type to your Arduino IDE after adding this additional board manager URL in preferences. 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jim-hunt/xbox-adapter/develop/arduino-board-manager/package_arduino-leonardo-lufa_index.json

Install the 'USB Host Shield Library 2.0' using the IDE libary manager.

Download or clone this repository onto your computer and open `XboxAdaper.ino` in the IDE.

Select the `Arduino Leonardo with LUFA` board before verifying that the sketch compiles without errors.

Warning: Because this sketch uses the USB port on the Leonardo to connect to the Xbox, after you've uploaded this sketch the first time you'll have to quickly press the reset button twice when the IDE finishes compiling and is ready to upload. 

Upload any sketch with the regular `Arduino Leonardo` board type to return to normal uploading.

# How to pair a DUALSHOCK3 (sixaxis) gamepad with the ESP32

The DUALSHOCK3 gamepad does not implement the entire Bluetooth stack. It requires "manual pairing" in order to work.

## Patch Bluepad32

By default, DS3 is disabled since it requires `gap_set_security_level(0)`.
But that change breaks Nintendo Switch and other gamepads, so it is disabled.
To enable it, you should change on setting in `menuconfig`:

```sh
idf.py menuconfig
```

And select `Component config` -> `Bluepad32` -> `Enable GAP Security` (must be disabled)

And then you have to re-compile the firmware (see here for [firmware compilation instructions]).

## Manual pair

### Fetch the ESP32 Bluetooth Address

* Connect a terminal to the ESP32 using 115200 baud 8N1.

* Watch the logs. You should see something like:

```
Bluepad32 (C) 2016-2020 Ricardo Quesada and contributors.
Firmware version: v2.0.0-beta
BTStack: Copyright (C) 2017 BlueKitchen GmbH.
Dual port / 1-button mode enabled
Gap security level: 0
BTstack up and running at CC:50:E3:AF:E2:96     <------ THIS IS THE BLUETOOTH ADDRESS
Btstack ready!
```

In this example, the ESP32 Address is "CC:50:E3:AF:E2:96".

### Plug in the DS3 gamepad

Plug in the DS3 gamepad to your PC. Should work on all Linux, Mac and Windows,
although I only tested it on Linux.

### Pair it

Install [HIDAPI][hidapi]. For Debian-based OSs, do:
```
$ sudo apt install libhidapi-dev
```

On Gentoo Linux run:
```
$ sudo emerge dev-libs/hidapi
```

For MacOS, Windows: I don't know, you are in your own.

* Compile the "sixaxis pairer":

```sh
$ cd bluepad32/tools
$ make sixaxispairer
$ ./sixaxispairer XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX  # Following our example, it should be CC:50:E3:AF:E2:96
```

### Unplug DS3 from computer

Unplug the DS3 gamepad from your computer and press the "Play" button on the DS3
to establish a connection with the ESP32. It might take a few seconds
(perhaps more than 10 seconds) to establish the connection.
